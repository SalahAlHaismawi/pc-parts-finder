# pc-parts-finder
This program looks for pc parts from the internet and shows u the price of the items like cpu's gpu's and ram sticks.
A new feature i just added is being able to view gpu benchmarks using 3DMARK.
the program writes all data to csv file which i will make use of later to try and predict gpu prices.
HOW TO RUN:
open 'pc' folder
Run Main.py
