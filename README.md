# pc-parts-finder
This program looks for pc parts from the internet and shows u the price of the items like cpu's gpu's and ram sticks.
A new feature i just added is being able to view gpu benchmarks using 3DMARK.
the program writes all data to csv file which i will make use of later to try and predict gpu prices.
this project is still ongoing and im working on it everyday to try to improve it and learn along the way.
